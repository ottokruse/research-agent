# Compare features of AWS Strands Agents SDK and Generative AI Toolkit

You will research both Strands Agents SDK and Generative AI Toolkit and compare their features, in order to determine how much they overlap.

Create a report in markdown. The report should have a table with these columns:

- Feature
- Available in Strands Agent SDK? Yes/No/Similar + explanation
- Available in Generative AI Toolkit? Yes/No/Similar + explanation

Start your research here:

- https://strandsagents.com/0.1.x/
- https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-toolkit/

This is how you must work to produce the report:

1. Research both projects, and follow relevant links to examples and documentation.
2. Tell the user which pages you have read
3. ALWAYS ask if the user thinks you have enough information to create your report
4. If the user confirms you have enough information: write your report to disk

Note that both libraries are new, and there are no good comparisons yet; it won't help you to web search for their differences, you'll have to come up with it yourself by comparing their docs. Be vigilant against "marketing fluff" in their docs that may advertise capabilities broadly. Draw only conclusions about capabilities from the code samples in the documentation.
