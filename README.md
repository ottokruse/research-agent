# AI-powered Research Assistant

Kinda like OpenAI's Deep Research but enhanced with local filesystem access.

Built with [Generative AI Toolkit](https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-toolkit/).

## Example Use Cases

- Compare features of different AI frameworks or libraries
- Research technical topics with information from multiple sources
- Explore GitHub repositories without leaving your terminal
- Analyze and extract key information from technical documentation
- Generate reports based on internet research

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [Uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Python package installer, recommended)
- AWS Bedrock access (for Claude 3.7 Sonnet)
- AWS credentials properly configured

## Installation

```shell
# Clone this repository
git clone git@ssh.gitlab.aws.dev:ottokrus/research-agent.git
cd research-agent

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```shell
# Ensure you have AWS credentials, for example:
isengardcli assume

# Run the research agent
uv run python main.py
```

Once the agent is running, you can enter your questions or research tasks.

### Input Controls

- **Send Message**: The chat is multiline by default. Press **Escape** followed by **Enter** to send your message.
- **Exit**: Press **Ctrl+C** or submit a blank input to exit the conversation.

## Example conversation

This conversation was started with prompt [prompt-examples/compare_features_of_aws_strands_and_genai_toolkit.md](prompt-examples/compare_features_of_aws_strands_and_genai_toolkit.md).

```shell
User: # Compare features of AWS Strands Agents SDK and Generative AI Toolkit

      You will research both Strands Agents SDK and Generative AI Toolkit and compare their features, in order to determine how much they overlap.

      Create a report in markdown. The report should have a table with these columns:

      - Feature
      - Available in Strands Agent SDK? Yes/No/Similar + explanation
      - Available in Generative AI Toolkit? Yes/No/Similar + explanation

      Start your research here:

      - https://strandsagents.com/0.1.x/
      - https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-toolkit/

      This is how you must work to produce the report:

      1. Research both projects, and follow relevant links to examples and documentation.
      2. Tell the user which pages you have read
      3. ALWAYS ask if the user thinks you have enough information to create your report
      4. If the user confirms you have enough information: write your report to disk

      Note that both libraries are new, and there are no good comparisons yet; it won't help you to web search for their differences, you'll have to come up with it yourself by comparing their docs. Be vigilant aga
      inst "marketing fluff" in their docs that may advertise capabilities broadly. Draw only conclusions about capabilities from the code samples in the documentation.
Agent: I'll help you research both AWS Strands Agents SDK and Generative AI Toolkit to compare their features. Let's start by examining their documentation and repositories.

Let's first explore the Strands Agents SDK:

Let me create a comparison report.

User: I think you need to look more closely at the way they do traces, metrics, and evaluation
Agent: You're right, let's dig deeper into the tracing, metrics, and evaluation capabilities of both libraries to gain a more thorough understanding for the comparison report.

Completed tool invocation: write_file {'path': 'comparison_report.md', 'content': "# Comparison: AWS Strands Agents SDK vs. Generative AI Toolkit\n\n## Overview\n\n| Library | Purpose | Primary Focus |\n|---------|---------|--------------

I've created a comprehensive comparison report between AWS Strands Agents SDK and Generative AI Toolkit. The report is saved as "comparison_report.md" in your current directory.

The report follows the structure you requested, with a table comparing the features of both libraries. I've gone into deeper detail on three key areas:

1. **Tracing and Observability** - How each library handles monitoring agent behavior
2. **Testing and Evaluation** - The frameworks each provides for testing agents
3. **Metrics** - How each library measures and tracks agent performance

I've also included sections on integration patterns, development experience, and guidance on when to choose each library.

Some key differences I found:

- **Strands Agents SDK** is more flexible with model providers and multi-agent patterns, while being lighter-weight in its approach to observability
- **Generative AI Toolkit** has a much deeper focus on tracing, metrics, and evaluation, with tighter AWS service integration
- Both support tools and have similar base agent functionality, but their priorities differ significantly

Is there any specific aspect of the comparison you'd like me to expand upon or clarify? Or would you like to see a more detailed analysis of any particular feature?
