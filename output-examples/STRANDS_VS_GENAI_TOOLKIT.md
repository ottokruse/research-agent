## Conclusion

Both AWS Strands Agents SDK and Generative AI Toolkit are powerful frameworks for building AI agents, but with different emphases and governance models:

- **Strands Agents SDK** is an official AWS service with a dedicated development team, currently in public preview. It excels in flexibility and extensibility, with rich support for multi-agent patterns, diverse model providers, and a modular architecture. It focuses on building agents with standard OpenTelemetry-based observability. Its multi-agent patterns are more diverse but treat subordinate agents as stateless tools. As an official AWS service, it comes with formal support channels and is expected to follow standard AWS service lifecycle.

- **Generative AI Toolkit** is an AWS Solutions Architect (SA) project maintained by SAs who build agents daily. It focuses on the complete lifecycle of LLM applications with exceptional observability, tracing, and evaluation capabilities. Its tracing system is not just for monitoring but serves as the foundation for evaluation, testing, and UI visualization. While it has fewer multi-agent patterns, its subordinate agents maintain their own conversation history and state. As an SA project, it doesn't have formal SLAs but is actively maintained based on customer value.

The frameworks have significant overlap in basic agent functionality but differ in their specialized features. Strands Agents SDK offers more diverse multi-agent patterns and model provider options, while Generative AI Toolkit provides a more integrated approach where traces power evaluation, testing, and UI features.

### Choosing Between Frameworks

| Consider Strands Agents SDK if you need: | Consider Generative AI Toolkit if you need: |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| An official AWS service with formal support | A solution focused on evaluation and operational monitoring |
| Rich multi-agent patterns (swarms, graphs, workflows) | Stateful subordinate agents in multi-agent systems |
| Support for many different model providers | Deep integration between traces, evaluation, and testing |
| A formally roadmapped AWS service | Practical tools built by SAs who work with agents daily |

Both frameworks are valuable additions to the AWS ecosystem for agent development, and the choice between them depends on your specific requirements and preferences regarding governance, features, and long-term support models.
